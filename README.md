# Expense-Tracker
Using SQL and Python


Developed our own Expense Tracker Application using Python and SQL. We used Tkinter library to manage GUIs of the application and MySQL for handling database related tasks. We added features like user authentication, adding, modifying, and deleting expenses, and displaying the expenses report.

Itâ€™s a great tool for managing finances
